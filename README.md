This is the source code of the paper "Deep-computer-generated holography with temporal-focusing and digital propagation matrix for rapid 3D multiphoton stimulation "submitted to Optics Express.  
This code is modified from the source code of "DeepCGH: 3D computer generated holography using deep learning".  
For our application, we add the simulation of temporal focusing & digital propagation matrix to improve the inference speed and axial confinement ability.  

The dependencies of this code include:
